      <p>Hello! My name is Joe Aniello and I am a current student in the UNC Coding Boot Camp. When I graduate, I hope to be a web or video game developer, but am also curious to see what the realm of virtual reality has to offer. I currently work in Division I college athletics, where I have spent the past five years in various ticket operations roles at multiple institutions. The reason I want to switch careers is because I want to engage in a field that offers creative freedom through logical thinking, a better work/life balance, and to learn more about the technology that makes every day life so much easier and hopefully create my own.</p>

      <p>I currently work for University of North Carolina Athletics as an Assistant Director of Ticket Operations. Before joining UNC, I spent a little over a year at Texas Tech as a Post-graduate Intern, and prior to that I worked as a Graduate Assistant at Wichita State while obtaining my Master's in Sport Management. My professional background through these positions has primarily revolved around customer service, but I would like to see what I can offer society besides a person at which to direct complaints and grievances. I have gained valuable and cherished experiences from this industry, but I believe there is more out there to accomplish, discover, and learn from the world.</p>

      <p>I am originally from Kansas, spent part of my childhood in Colorado, but moved to North Carolina from Texas in 2017. My favorite movie franchise is Star Wars. My favorite game is Asassin's Creed (I got my start on that series with Black Flag). I have a fiance, Natalie, and we will be married in November. Some fun facts about myself: I was in marching band in college at the University of Kansas; I survived an unexpected, life-threatening illness when I was 21 years old; and I have an inexplicable ability to quote almost any movie or TV show after only seeing it once.</p>
